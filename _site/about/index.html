<h1>About Philomaths</h1>
<p>Philomaths owns and operates <a href="https://www.thegolfmentor.com/club_distance_calculator">The Golf Mentor</a> application. This features a golf club distances calculator, and is one of the highest ranking sites in the world for information on golf club distances. The site and associated IOS app earn revenue from subscriptions and advertising.</p>
<p>Philomaths carries out mathematical research into golf handicapping, Attitude Heading Reference Systems, Covid-19, and other areas. Philomaths has provided expert witness consultancy to law firms in London, San Francisco, Sydney, and Dallas. The consultancy areas include cellular location technology, the Global Positioning System, and the lower layers of telecommunication systems.</p>
<p>Philomaths undertakes a range of public service activities including open source software. It added spell checking functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/commit/cbd6d47051b2050fd8dbd0e3a3751b2364bc3842">rspec gem</a>. The version of the gem that includes that functionality has had over 7 million <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-core/versions/3.9.1">downloads</a>. Philomaths developed a structured tree speller for the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/did_you_mean/pull/119">Did You Mean gem</a> that can use a structured dictionary. The algorithm provides a halving of the error rate and a ten times increase in speed when working with a structured dictionary. The master branch of the Did You Mean gem provides the facility to apply the structured tree speller to assist in fixing Ruby <a href="https://github.com/ruby/did_you_mean/pull/143">load path errors</a>.</p>
